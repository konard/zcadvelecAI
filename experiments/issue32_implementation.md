# Issue #32 Implementation: Polyline Grip Shape and Dragging Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Polyline Distortion During Dragging
**File:** `cad_source/zengine/core/entities/uzeentpolyline.pas`
**Method:** `rtmodifyonepoint` (lines 288-315)

**Problem:** When dragging a segment center grip, both endpoints were incorrectly moved by adding the offset directly without proper coordinate calculation, causing distortion.

**Solution:** Implemented proper calculation similar to line entity:
1. Calculate half-vector from segment center to each endpoint
2. Calculate new center position from drag offset
3. Reposition both endpoints relative to new center using half-vector

```pascal
// Old (buggy) code:
offset:=rtmod.dist;
v1^:=VertexAdd(v1^,offset);
v2^:=VertexAdd(v2^,offset);

// New (fixed) code:
halfVector:=uzegeometry.VertexSub(v2^,v1^);
halfVector:=uzegeometry.VertexMulOnSc(halfVector,0.5);
newCenter:=VertexAdd(rtmod.point.worldcoord,rtmod.dist);
v1^:=VertexSub(newCenter,halfVector);
v2^:=VertexAdd(newCenter,halfVector);
```

### 2. Added Segment Direction to Control Points
**File:** `cad_source/zengine/core/entities/uzeentpolyline.pas`
**Method:** `addcontrolpoints` (lines 273-287)

**Change:** Store segment direction vector in the `dcoord` field of control point descriptor for segment center grips (os_midle type).

```pascal
// Store segment direction in dcoord for oriented grip drawing
pdesc.dcoord:=VertexSub(pvnext^,pv^);
```

This allows the drawing code to know the segment orientation for rendering the oriented rectangle grip.

### 3. Implemented Oriented Rectangle Grips
**File:** `cad_source/zengine/containers/UGDBControlPointArray.pas`

**Changes:**
1. Added `uzesnap` to uses clause (line 24) to access `os_midle` constant
2. Modified `draw` method (lines 44-100) to:
   - Detect segment center grips by checking `point^.pointtype=os_midle`
   - Calculate oriented rectangle aligned with segment direction
   - Use `DrawQuad3DInModelSpace` to render the oriented rectangle
   - Keep square grips for vertex points

**Implementation Details:**
- Rectangle aspect ratio: 2:1 (long side along segment direction)
- Grip size calculated from projection matrix to maintain consistent screen size
- Perpendicular direction calculated using cross product with Z-axis
- Falls back to Y-axis if segment is vertical

```pascal
if point^.pointtype=os_midle then begin
  // Draw oriented rectangle grip
  segmentDir:=NormalizeVector(point^.dcoord);
  perpDir:=CrossVertex(segmentDir,CreateVertex(0,0,1));
  // ... calculate 4 corners ...
  dc.drawer.DrawQuad3DInModelSpace(p1,p2,p3,p4,dc.DrawingContext.matrixs);
end else begin
  // Draw normal square grip
  dc.drawer.DrawPoint3DInModelSpace(point^.worldcoord,dc.DrawingContext.matrixs);
end;
```

## Testing

The changes should be tested by:
1. Opening a drawing with polylines
2. Selecting a polyline to show grips
3. Verifying segment center grips appear as oriented rectangles
4. Dragging segment center grips to verify no distortion occurs
5. Testing with both open and closed polylines

## Technical Notes

- The `dcoord` field in `controlpointdesc` is reused to store direction data, following the pattern already used in `uzeentcomplex.pas`
- The grip size calculation uses the projection matrix to ensure grips maintain consistent screen size at different zoom levels
- The perpendicular calculation handles the edge case of vertical segments by switching to a different axis
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code

## Files Modified

1. `cad_source/zengine/core/entities/uzeentpolyline.pas` - Fixed dragging, added direction data
2. `cad_source/zengine/containers/UGDBControlPointArray.pas` - Implemented oriented grip drawing
